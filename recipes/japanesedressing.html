<h1>Japanese Ginger Dressing</h1>
<img src="../images/japanesedressing.jpg" alt="picture of Japanese ginger dressing">
<p>You probably recognize this dressing from a visit to a Japanese steakhouse.  Despite its seemingly exotic nature, Japanese ginger dressing has a simple list of ingredients and is a cinch to make.</p>

<p>All you need are a few kitchen staples and a blender. This dressing pairs well with a simple salad of iceberg lettuce, chopped tomatoes, and grated carrot, but feel free to experiment.  I personally enjoy it in a cabbage slaw or over sliced cucumbers with a sprinkle of sesame seeds .</p>

<h3>INGREDIENTS</h3>
<ul>
    <li>7 ounces of peeled and chopped carrots</li>
    <li>4 ounces of peeled and chopped onion</li>
    <li>1 Tbsp of granulated sugar</li>
    <li>1/4 cup of soy sauce</li>
    <li>1/2 cup of rice vinegar</li>
    <li>1/2 tsp of salt</li>
    <li>3/4 cup of vegetable oil</li>
</ul>

<h3>DIRECTIONS</h3>
<ol>
    <li>put all of the ingredients except the oil in a blender and puree</li>
    <li>slowly add the oil and blend until emulsified</li>
    <li>serve with your favorite salad</li>
</ol>
