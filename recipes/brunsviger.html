<h1>Brunsviger</h1>
<img src="../images/brunsviger.jpg" alt="picture of brunsviger">
<p>This is a recipe for the Danish coffee cake called "brunsviger". It comes from the island of Fyn (Funen), where Hans Christian Andersen was born. Danes often eat brunsviger with coffee on Sunday mornings. </p>

<p>The recipe starts with a yested dough similar to the base of cinnamon rolls.  Instead of rolling out the dough, you press it into a baking dish.  Then, you top it with a mixture of butter and sugar before baking.  Enjoy! </p>
